SimpleToDo is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: Deepa Saini

Time spent: 24 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* User can **persist todo items** and retrieve them properly on app restart

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* Persist the todo items [into SQLite](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Persisting-Data-to-the-Device#sqlite) instead of a text file
* Added custom adapter, styling todo.
* Added dialog fragments for user feedback.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* Feedback to user using dialog fragment.
* Empty item names are not allowed.

## Notes

TODO: Need to figure out how to handle duplicate item names. This can be handled more cleanly once more features like **Due Date** or **Priority for todo items** are added in the app.
